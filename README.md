## Step One - Install Python 

To get started, youâ€™ll need to install **Python version 3.12.10**.

After the download open up the installation, make sure Add to Path is checked on and follow through with the installation.

## Step Two Package Installation 

Before using the K-SPICE API, youâ€™ll need some extra Python tools (called "packages") that help with data handling, math, and plotting. 
### First, open the Command Prompt window by either:

- Typing `cmd` in the Windows search bar and pressing **Enter**, or  
- Pressing **Windows key + R**, typing `cmd`, then pressing **Enter**

If done correctly a window similar to this shoudl pop up on your screen:

#### Installing `pip`

`pip` is a tool that lets you download and install other useful Python packages. It usually comes with Python, but if itâ€™s missing, you can install it by running:

```bash
python -m ensurepip --upgrade

```



#### Then, install the packages:

```bash
python -m pip install matplotlib numpy pandas datetime
```

This will install:

- `matplotlib` â€“ for creating plots and graphs
- `numpy` â€“ for working with numbers and arrays
- `pandas` â€“ for handling data tables and CSV files
- `datetime` â€“ for handling timelines

You can always come back to this step and install more packages later using the same format:

```shell
python -m pip install <library-name>
```

## Step Three â€“ Set up Visual Studio Code editor

## Step Four â€“ Configure Path Variables


## Step Five â€“ Do a test run.

copy paste this code (add code the user can copy paste) and check if it compiles. If it compiled Congratulations you can start with the K-Spice API
