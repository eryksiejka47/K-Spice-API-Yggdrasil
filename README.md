## Step One - Install Python 

To get started, youâ€™ll need to install **Python version 3.12.10**.

ðŸ‘‰ https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31210/

Make sure to select the correct installer for your system, as shown below:

Double-click the downloaded file. You should see a window like this:

Chcek the "Add python.exe to path" and then click on "Customize installation" and check the boxes for:

Be sure that python is added to enviroment variables and click install.

## Step Two Package Installation 

Before using the K-SPICE API, youâ€™ll need some extra Python tools (called "packages") that help with data handling, math, and plotting. 
### First, open the Command Prompt window by either:

- Typing `cmd` in the Windows search bar and pressing **Enter**, or  
- Pressing **Windows key + R**, typing `cmd`, then pressing **Enter**

If done correctly a window similar to this shoudl pop up on your screen:

#### Installing `pip`

`pip` is a tool that lets you download and install other useful Python packages. It usually comes with Python, but if itâ€™s missing, you can install it by running:

```bash
python -m ensurepip --upgrade

```



#### Then, install the packages:

```bash
python -m pip install matplotlib numpy pandas datetime
```

This will install:

- `matplotlib` â€“ for creating plots and graphs
- `numpy` â€“ for working with numbers and arrays
- `pandas` â€“ for handling data tables and CSV files
- `datetime` â€“ for handling timelines

You can always come back to this step and install more packages later using the same format:

```shell
python -m pip install <library-name>
```

## Step Three â€“ Set up Visual Studio Code editor

## Step Four â€“ Folder Structure 

If you have used K-Spice before without the API you probably have this step completed, however for first time users make sure that you store your project files in a proper way that K-spice easliy can read them.

## Step Five â€“ Configure Path Variables

Open up the search bar in windows and type in "edit enviroment variables for your account" and open it. A window like this shoudl pop up: 


![cmd](images/enviroment_variables.png)
## Step six â€“ Do a test run.

Use the code below to. If it compiled Congratulations you can start with the K-Spice API

```python
# Importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from datetime import timedelta
import csv
import kspice

# Version Check
print("KSPICE version:", kspice.__version__)

# Path for project folder 
sim = kspice.Simulator(r"C:\K-Spice-Projects\DemoProject") 

# Activvating the timeline
tl = sim.timelines[0]
tl.activate()

# Load models, parameters, initial_conditions 
tl.load("KSpiceTutorial Model", "KSpiceTutorial Model", "Steady_state")

# Run timeline for 120 seconds 
sim_time = timedelta(seconds=120)
tl.run_for(sim_time)

# Deactivate the timeline
tl.deactivate()

# Close project 
sim.close_project()
```

If you get an error that the Kspice library is not found try including it this way: 

```python

import sys
sys.path.append(r"C:/Program Files (x86)/Kongsberg/K-Spice/bin64")
import kspice
```

### Testing in debug mode
