### 1. Step One â€“ Install Python

To get started, youâ€™ll need to install **Python version 3.12.10**.

### 2. Step Two â€“ Install Required Python Packages

Before using the K-SPICE API, youâ€™ll need some extra Python tools (called "packages") that help with data handling, math, and plotting. We will start with downloading PIP. 

#### First, what is `pip`?

`pip` is a tool that lets you download and install other useful Python tools (called packages). It usually comes with Python, but if itâ€™s missing, you can install it by running:

```bash
python -m ensurepip --upgrade

```

#### Then, install the packages:

```bash
python -m pip install matplotlib numpy pandas
```

This will install:

- `matplotlib` â€“ for creating plots and graphs
- `numpy` â€“ for working with numbers and arrays
- `pandas` â€“ for handling data tables and CSV files

You can always come back to this step and install more packages later using the same format:

```shell
python -m pip install <library-name>
