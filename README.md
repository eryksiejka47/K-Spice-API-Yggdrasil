### 2. Step Two â€“ Install Required Python Packages

Before using the K-SPICE API, youâ€™ll need some extra Python tools (called "packages") that help with data handling, math, and plotting. We will start with downloading PIP. 

#### First, what is `pip`?

`pip` is a tool that lets you download and install other useful Python tools (called packages). It usually comes with Python, but if itâ€™s missing, you can install it by running:

```bash
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
```

#### Then, install the packages:

```bash
python -m pip install matplotlib numpy pandas
```
