## Step One - Install Python 

To get started, you’ll need to install **Python version 3.12.10**.

👉 https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31210/

Make sure to select the correct installer for your system, as shown below:

Double-click the downloaded file. You should see a window like this:

Chcek the "Add python.exe to PATH" and then click on "Customize installation" and check the boxes for:

![alt](images/python2.png)

Click on "Next" and check the following options:
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **Documentation**

Click "Install" to complete the installation. 

---

## Step Two - Package Installation 

Before using the K-SPICE API, you’ll need some extra Python tools (called "packages") that help with data handling, math, and plotting. 
### First, open the Command Prompt window by either:

- Typing `cmd` in the Windows search bar and pressing **Enter**, or  
- Pressing **Windows key + R**, typing `cmd`, then pressing **Enter**

If done correctly a window similar to this should pop up on your screen:

#### Installing `pip`

`pip` is a tool that lets you download and install other useful Python packages. It usually comes with Python, but if it’s missing, you can install it by running:

```bash
python -m ensurepip --upgrade

```

#### Then, install the packages:

```bash
python -m pip install matplotlib numpy pandas datetime
```

This will install:

- `matplotlib` – for creating plots and graphs
- `numpy` – for working with numbers and arrays
- `pandas` – for handling data tables and CSV files
- `datetime` – for handling timelines

You can always come back to this step and install more packages later using the same format:

```shell
python -m pip install <library-name>
```

## Step Three – Set up Visual Studio Code editor


To run your Python scripts, you need to install an environment that supports Python execution.

I recommend using **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**, and I’ll quickly guide you through how to set it up. However, feel free to use any environment you prefer — if you already have a favorite, go for it!

#### Why VS Code?
- Lightweight and fast
- Great Python support with extensions
- Built-in terminal and debugger
- Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

You can **Download and install VS Code** by following the link down below: 

👉https://code.visualstudio.com/download


This should be pretty straightforward — just follow the necessary steps in the *VS Code installer*, however if you struggle check out the video down below: 

👉https://youtu.be/cu_ykIfBprI?feature=shared

Once the installation is complete and you open the application:

1. Go to the **Extensions** tab (you can also press `Ctrl+Shift+X` on your keyboard)

2. In the search bar, type **"Python"**

3. Look for the extension published by **Microsoft** and click **Install**

The screenshot below shows where to find the Extensions tab and which Python extension to install:

## Step Four – Folder Structure 

If you have used K-Spice before without the API you probably have this step completed, however for first time users make sure that you store your project files in a proper way that K-spice easliy can read them.

Create a folder on your **C: drive** with any name you like.  
In the screenshot below, you’ll see I named mine **K-Space-Projects** — this is just to illustrate that you can choose whatever name suits you.

Keep all your **K-Spice projects** organized inside this folder.


![cmd](images/path_projects.png)

Just remember to specify in **K-Spice Sim Explorer** which folder you’re using to store your projects:

![cmd](images/k_spice_start.png)


## Step Five – Configure Path Variables
### Verifying the K-Spice API Package

First, it’s important to verify that the **K-Spice API package** is located in the `bin64` folder.

In the screenshot below, we can see the following file:

```
kspice.cp312-win_amd64
```

This filename provides useful information:

- **`cp312`**: Indicates compatibility with **Python 3.12**.
- **`win_amd64`**: Specifies that the package is intended for **64-bit Windows systems**.

This explains why Python 3.12 is required for the K-Spice API to function correctly on your system.

![cmd](images/bin64.PNG)

Open up the search bar in windows and type in "edit enviroment variables for your account" and open it. A window like this should pop up: 

![cmd](images/enviroment_variables.png)

We need to add a new user variable, therefore press "New..." and name the variable "PYTHONPATH". Next, copy and paste the line below in the "Variable value" field:

```shell
C:\Program Files (x86)\Kongsberg\K-Spice\bin64
```
It should look like this:

![cmd](images/PYTHONPATH.png)

## Step six – Do a test run.

Use the code below to. If it compiled Congratulations you can start with the K-Spice API

```python
# Importing necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from datetime import timedelta
import csv
import kspice

# Version Check
print("KSPICE version:", kspice.__version__)

# Path for project folder 
sim = kspice.Simulator(r"C:\K-Spice-Projects\DemoProject") 

# Activvating the timeline
tl = sim.timelines[0]
tl.activate()

# Load models, parameters, initial_conditions 
tl.load("KSpiceTutorial Model", "KSpiceTutorial Model", "Steady_state")

# Run timeline for 120 seconds 
sim_time = timedelta(seconds=120)
tl.run_for(sim_time)

# Deactivate the timeline
tl.deactivate()

# Close project 
sim.close_project()
```

If you get an error that the Kspice library is not found try including it this way: 

```python

import sys
sys.path.append(r"C:/Program Files (x86)/Kongsberg/K-Spice/bin64")
import kspice
```

### Testing in debug mode
