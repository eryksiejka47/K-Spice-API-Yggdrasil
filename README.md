### 2. Step Two â€“ Install Required Python Packages

Before using the K-SPICE API, you need to install some useful Python packages.

#### First, make sure `pip` is installed:

If you're using Windows and Python 3.12.10, `pip` should already be included. But if it's not, you can install it by running:

```bash
python -m ensurepip --upgrade
```

#### Then, install the packages:

Open your terminal or command prompt and run this one command to install everything at once:

```bash
python -m pip install matplotlib numpy pandas
```
