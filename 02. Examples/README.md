# Code and Use Cases

The purpose of this project is to provide users with a simple way to interact with large models in K-Spice by leveraging the K-Spice API.
The focus was on making the code modular and easy to understand. To achieve this, the interaction logic was divided into three main components: Gathering, Processing, and Display, as illustrated in the figure below.
